# abcde-mac-autorip

Automatically rip Audio CDs upon insert without iTunes -- like it's 2002.

* Inspect `.abcde.conf and adapt to your desires.
* Install `abcde` and necessary dependencies. Everything is available through homebrew.
* Copy `rip.scpt` and `rip.sh` someplace handy.
* Open `rip.scpt` in the AppleScript Editor.
* Change the path to `rip.sh` to where you have it.
* Save the script as an Application, this will be `rip.app`.
* `touch rip.log` in the directory where you have `rip.sh`.
* Open CD & DVD preferences
* Tell it to run `rip.app` whenever an Audio CD is inserted.
